    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    BF:49:9E:27:CB:FB:3F:AF:35:C8:1B:27:97:11:B5:5A:C7:66:76:23

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    BF:49:9E:27:CB:FB:3F:AF:35:C8:1B:27:97:11:B5:5A:C7:66:76:23

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
    -->
    <string name="google_maps_key" translatable="false" templateMergeStrategy="preserve">
        this is my key
    </string>
